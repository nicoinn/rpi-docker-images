# rpi-docker-images

A few useful containerised apps for running on my Raspberry Pis. 

Each app lives in its own branch and are available on (https://hub.docker.com/r/nicoinn/)[my Docker hub repo] 

Also...  yes, I know, that's not how one is supposed to use git branches - but hey, works for me ;)
